# Code of Conduct for using [Marlon Richert](https://github.com/marlonrichert)'s repos on GitHub

By interacting with any of my repos on GitHub, you agree to abide by the following rules:
* *Issues* are for bug reports and feature requests. If your issue is neither of these (or you're not sure), then please first start a *Discussion.*
* *Discussions* in a repo are for help with that repo only. They are not general support forums. If you have questions outside the scope of the repo, then please ask them elsewhere.
