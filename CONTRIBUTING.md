# How to contribute to [Marlon Richert](https://github.com/marlonrichert)'s repos on GitHub

Thanks for wanting to contribute! üòÉ Here are some ways you can help me out:

## [Sponsor Me](https://github.com/sponsors/marlonrichert) üíù
Thank me for my efforts by throwing me a couple of dollars each month.  Why don't you?  üôÇ I don't care about the actual
amount; you'll always get a Sponsor badge on your profile in return.

## Submit a Pull Request

The most helpful way to contribute code is to submit a pull request that resolves *an open issue.* Additionally, to make
the review of your code as quick as possible, please try to adhere to the following guidelines:
* Use the same style as the existing code.
* Follow the [Seven Rules of a Great Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
* Try to keep the number of commits in one pull request to the absolute minimum (within reason).

## Open an Issue
The most helpful way to report a bug is to provide me with
[minimal, reproducible test case](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).  Also, if the repo you're
reporting a bug on contains a bug report template, then please *follow the bug report template to the letter.* Remember,
if I cannot reproduce the bug, then I cannot fix it.

Suggestions are welcome, too, but before opening a new feature request, please consider starting a *discussion* about your ideas
first.
