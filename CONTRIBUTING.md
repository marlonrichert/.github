# Contributing [Marlon Richert](https://github.com/marlonrichert)'s repos on GitHub

Thanks for wanting to contribute! üòÉ

Here are the main ways you can help me out:

## [Sponsor me!](https://github.com/sponsors/marlonrichert) üíù 
Show me some love by throwing me a dollar (or more?) each month. Why don't you? üôÇ I don't care about the actual amount; I'll always give you a badge on your profile in return.

## Submit a Pull Request
I always welcome code contributions, no matter how big or small. However, to make this transaction as smooth as possible, please try to adhere to the following guidelines:
  * Follow the [Seven Rules of a Great Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
  * Squash your commits (within reason) _before_ pushing them.
  
## Submit a Bug Report
Thanks for helping me test my software! However, to make sure the bug you've found is in fact in my software and not somewhere else, please *follow the bug report template to the letter.* Remember: If I cannot reproduce the bug, then I cannot fix it.

## Submit a Feature Request
You're welcome to suggest all kinds of enhancements. However, please consider whether perhaps you should start a *Discussion* about your ideas first.
