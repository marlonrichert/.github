# Contributing [Marlon Richert](https://github.com/marlonrichert)'s repos on GitHub

Thanks for wanting to contribute! üòÉ

Here are the main ways you can help me out:

## [Sponsor me!](https://github.com/sponsors/marlonrichert)
Thank me for my efforts by throwing me a couple of dollars each month. Why don't you? üôÇ I don't care about the actual amount; you'll always get a Sponsor badge on your profile in return üíù  

## Contribute Code
The most helpful way to contribute code is to submit a pull request that resolves *an open issue.* Additionally, to make the review of your code as quick as possible, please try to adhere to the following guidelines:
  * Follow the [Seven Rules of a Great Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
  * Try to keep the number of commits in one pull request to the absolute minimum (within reason).
  
## File a Bug Report
The most helpful way to report a bug is to provide me with [minimal reproducible test case](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Also, if the repo you're reporting a bug on contains a bug report template, then please *follow the bug report template to the letter.* Remember, if I cannot reproduce the bug, then I cannot fix it.

## Submit a Feature Request
Suggestions are always welcome, but before opening a new issue, please consider starting a *discussion* about your ideas first.
